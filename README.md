# Stock-Price-Predictor

• Developed a script that performs Support Vector Regression(SVR) on date-price data to predict novel prices
• Implemented various kernels, including linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF), to train the SVR
models effectively on date and price datasets
• Leveraged the matplotlib library to create insightful visualizations, showcasing the predicted prices obtained from
each SVR model
